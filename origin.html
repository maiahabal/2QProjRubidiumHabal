			<h1>BETA GAMEPLAY</h1>
			<article>
				The game has an official release date of June 2, 2020, but in April 7 of the same year, a closed beta was released. The beta was available for the regions Canada, United States, Russia, Turkey, and Europe. Developers had a goal to reach out to more regions such as the Asia Pacific, only if possible given the rising pandemic at the time, but they were successful. Beta gameplay wasn't perfect, there were plenty of kinks to straighten out in the gameplay before the official release. With the help of feedback from the players themselves and active response, VALORANT established itself.

			<h1>BASIC HISTORY</h1>
			<article>
			As mentioned previously, this game was published by Riot Games last June 2020. Above features the main team of people who worked on making the game what it is today. VALORANT has been hyped up by Riot for a while even before the release of the beta which gave the game it's own audience early on. If you are familiar with <a href="https://lol.garena.ph/">League of Legends</a>, another game by Riot, they are known to have collaborations with VALORANT through skins and such. <a href="https://arcane.com/en-sg/">Arcane</a> is currently the hyped up event between these Riot games.
